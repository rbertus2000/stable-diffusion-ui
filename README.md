3. Minimum 8 GB of RAM.

You don't need to install or struggle with Python, Anaconda, Docker etc. The installer will take care of whatever is needed.

# Installation
1. **Download** [for Windows](https://github.com/cmdr2/stable-diffusion-ui/releases/download/v2.16/stable-diffusion-ui-win64.zip) or [for Linux](https://github.com/cmdr2/stable-diffusion-ui/releases/download/v2.16/stable-diffusion-ui-linux.tar.xz).

2. **Extract**:
  - For Windows: After unzipping the file, please move the `stable-diffusion-ui` folder to your `C:` (or any drive like D:, at the top root level), e.g. `C:\stable-diffusion-ui`. This will avoid a common problem with Windows (file path length limits).
  - For Linux: After extracting the .tar.xz file, please open a terminal, and go to the `stable-diffusion-ui` directory.

3. **Run**:
  - For Windows: `Start Stable Diffusion UI.cmd` by double-clicking it.
  - For Linux: In the terminal, run `./start.sh` (or `bash start.sh`)

This will automatically install Stable Diffusion, set it up, and start the interface. No additional steps are needed.

**To Uninstall:** Just delete the `stable-diffusion-ui` folder to uninstall all the downloaded packages.
